    "Description": "Maybe this issue doubles [#455](https://htmltodocx.codeplex.com/workitem/455) but I am not sure what the mentioned changeset does as the source control is not available currently.\r\n\r\nThe current code in _h2d_htmlconverter.php_ in line _#96_\r\ndoes the following:\r\n```\r\n  // Convert entities:\r\n  $text = html_entity_decode($text, ENT_COMPAT, 'UTF-8');\r\n```\r\nThis removes all htmlentities like &auml; (umlauts) which is correct and needed for xml.\r\nBut it also remove entities like &amp; which is needed in XML too. I am getting invalid docx-Documents if the HTML contains & and other signs.\r\n\r\nPossible Solution is to first remove all entities, then encode the characters which are relevant for xml again.\r\n```\r\n// Convert entities:\r\n  $text = html_entity_decode($text, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');\r\n  $text = htmlspecialchars($text,ENT_QUOTES,'UTF-8');\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorks fine for me.\r\n\r\nRegards",
