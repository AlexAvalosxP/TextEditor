      "Message": "Thank you for spotting that.\n\nI've updated the [source code](https://htmltodocx.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest) with the change you suggested. I've done this on line 461 for a elements and line 650 for img elements. I haven't tested it though - could you let me know if the updated version of the converter works for you - I can then update the download files.",

      "Message": "Thank you for your response!\n\nI integrated the change in line 461 in my code too and could not see any problems so far. Looking at the code I think there is not much that could go wrong with it.\nAnyway I will report any problems that may occur.\n\nThough my code is a little bit different than yours as I also have the changes from [#486](https://htmltodocx.codeplex.com/workitem/486)\nFurthermore - as my Code is still under development I currently have also other issues with the docx-Generation in general, which may interfere anyway.",
