    "Description": "Presently inline styles contained in an HTML element are replaced with a PHPWord attribute-value pair using an array which requires you to define the entire css attribute-value pair you want to map to a PHPWord one. This is highly inefficient for obtaining a style which includes a numerical value (e.g. colours and spacings), as, for example, you'd need to define each colour value you want to map to a PHPWord colour value. This improvement would allow variables to be included in the style mapping, with a conversion where necessary (e.g. pixels to twips).",
