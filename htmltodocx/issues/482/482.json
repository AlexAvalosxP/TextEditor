    "Description": "First of all thank you for this awesome project! I'm currently using it for a drupal project to create printable documents from nodes and it saved me a lot of time!\r\n\r\nCurrently i'm looking for a way to add html as a footer to the document.\r\n\r\nI think it shouldn't be much efford to implement, because the classes \"PHPWord_Section\" and  \"PHPWord_Section_Header\" are providing almost the same functionality to add content.\r\n\r\nIs there a maybe already a solution to use htmltodocx for this? How would you solve it? \r\n",
