    "Description": "I could not find a way to add paragraph styles. My goal was to have a table cell with spaceAfter = 0.... ended up using PHPWord directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: maybe it is also a bug in PHPWord? It seems if you add a emtpy cell, it is not possible to avoid the space-after. however if you add empty text to the cell with spaceafter=0, it works.",
