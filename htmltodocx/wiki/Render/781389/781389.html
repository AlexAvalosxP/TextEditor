<div class="wikidoc"><h2>HTML to docx Converter set up details</h2>
<h3>Requirements - server</h3>
<ul><li>PHP 5.2.x or later;</li>
<li>PHP Extension ZipArchive;</li>
<li>PHP Extension libxml;</li></ul>
<br />Check output of phpinfo() to see if your installation meets these requirements.<br />
<h3>Requirements - client</h3>
This converter produces Word documents in the docx (Office Open XML) file format. The client will need a programme that can open these, for example Microsoft Word 2007 or later or an earlier version of Word with the Micorsoft Office Compatibility Pack or Libre Office or Open Office.<br />
<h3>Installation</h3>
Place the files on your web server somewhere where it serves files from - for example in a httpdocs directory.<br />
<h3>Documentation and checking if it works</h3>
Browse to htmltodocx/documentation/index.php, for example go to http://mysite.local/htmltodocx/documentation/index.php in your web server if that is where you have placed your files.<br /><br />You should be seeing a page of documentation, if not, then PHP is probably not set up properly on the server.<br /><br />Click on the link at the top of the page &quot;Download this page as a Word document&quot;. Open the downloaded Word document - it should look similar to the documentation web page. If you encounter a problem here, check the server requirements above.<br />
<h3>Understanding how it works</h3>
To get the best out of this software, you should read this documentation page in conjunction with the PHPWord documentation - PHPWord_Docs_0.6.2.docx - which you can find in the phpword directory. Understanding both of these will enable you to style the resulting docx documents in a way most appropriate for you.<br />
<h3>Production sites</h3>
You don&#39;t need to - and it is probably not desirable to - include all the documentation on a production site. You will just need to keep the following directories and their contents:
<ul><li>htmltodocx_converter</li>
<li>phpword</li>
<li>simplehtmldom</li></ul>
<br />In addition, you could remove the &quot;Example&quot; directory from the phpword directory.<br />
