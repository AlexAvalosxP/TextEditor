I guess you have tried what other people have suggested and removed the use of utf8_encode() from the PHPWord code.

Note, I haven't fully tested this (but it looks alright from what I have tried so far). Also, table styling in PHPWord appears to apply to all cells within the table (e.g. setting the border applies to all the cells not just the border of the table) - I haven't had a chance to verify that with a clean version of PHPWord though.</p>",
